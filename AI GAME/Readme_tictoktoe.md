‚ùå‚≠ï TIC-TAC-TOE AI GAME (with Minimax Algorithm)
===========================================================

1. GAME OVERVIEW
----------------
This is a Tic-Tac-Toe game built in Python using the tkinter GUI library.
The player (‚ùå) competes against a computer opponent (‚≠ï). The goal is to
get three of your marks in a straight line ‚Äî horizontally, vertically, or
diagonally.

The AI uses the Minimax algorithm to calculate the best possible moves,
making the gameplay intelligent and strategic.

-----------------------------------------------------------
2. HOW TO RUN
-----------------------------------------------------------
No external libraries are required. tkinter comes preinstalled with Python 3.

A. Prerequisites
   - Python 3.x
