File: BFS.py

**Purpose:**
Implements Breadth-First Search (BFS) to traverse all nodes level by level in a graph using a queue.

**How it works:**
Starts from a given node, visits it, and explores all its neighbors before moving to the next level.

**Complexity:**

Time: O(V + E)

Space: O(V)

**Applications:**
Shortest path in unweighted graphs, social network analysis, web crawling, finding connected components, peer-to-peer networks.
