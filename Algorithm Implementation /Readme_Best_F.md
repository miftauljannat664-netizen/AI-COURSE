Best-First Search Algorithm

File: best_first_search.py

**Purpose:**
Implements the Best-First Search algorithm, which explores the most promising node first based on heuristic values.

**How it works:**
At each step, the algorithm selects the node with the lowest heuristic value (h) from a priority queue and continues until the goal is found or all nodes are visited.

**Complexity:**

Time: O(E log V)

Space: O(V)

**Applications:**
Used in pathfinding, AI planning, route optimization, and web crawling where heuristics guide the search.
