DFS (Depth-First Search) Algorithm

**File:** dfs.py

**Purpose:**
Implements Depth-First Search (DFS) to traverse all nodes in a graph.

How it works:
Starts from a given node, visits it, then recursively explores unvisited neighbors until all nodes are visited.

**Complexity:
**
Time: O(V + E)

Space: O(V)

**Applications:**
Pathfinding, maze solving, cycle detection, topological sorting.
