Steps of How I Made the Video and Presentation

1. Creating the Presentation using Presentation.ai

I opened Presentation.ai
 â€” an AI-powered presentation maker.

I typed my topic summary, including the algorithms I implemented and the tools I explored.

The AI automatically generated 10â€“12 professional slides with proper layout, icons, and colors.

I customized the text and design slightly to match my project theme.

2. Creating the Video using InVideo AI

I used InVideo AI
 to generate a short AI-based video summarizing my course project.

I provided a short text script describing my algorithms, AI games, and learning outcomes.

The AI tool automatically created the video with voiceover, visuals, and transitions.

I previewed the result, made small edits, and exported the final 1+ minute video.
